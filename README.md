# r-ncdf4-build-opendap-windows
A windows build of the ncdf4 R package, that has opendap capability

The R package ncdf4 is a fantastic tool to read and handle netcdf files. But... on Windows you may have experienced that it is not possible to read files made available on the web as opendap files (e.g. thredds servers). It does work on Linux and Mac, though, but compilation of these functions for Windows was a hard nut to crack.
This build has, after some deep puzzling, resolved the problem. The package is available as a zip file for installation.

Instructions: download the zip file. Install the package ncdf4, choose installing from local archive, select the downloaded zip file, install, use.

Enjoy!
